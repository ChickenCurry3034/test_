In-App Community and Group Chat

When you share and communicate using our community features in the App, including Group Chat, you select the audience for the post. For in-App Community, if you select the “Public” option for your audience, anyone who has joined the App community platform can also view it.  This includes your username and any content you share as a post, comment, or question within the App community. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared, or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and by other services that integrate with our Services.

For in-App Group Chat, your username and any content you post or share within the Group Chat chatroom will be visible to anyone who has been invited to the chatroom.  We do not use the content shared in Group Chat chatrooms for any purpose other than to facilitate the functionality of the chatrooms.

With your consent, we may use and publicly display the pregnancy story or content you choose to share and post on the App community platform for educational, marketing and public relations purposes.

You should carefully consider what you choose to share on the App community platform and Group Chat because people who can see your activity on our Services can choose to share it with others on and off our Services platform, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Services, in person or in virtual reality experiences. Also, when you comment on someone else’s post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person’s content.

Other users can also use our Services to create and share content about you with the community. For example, other users can mention you in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you in our Services, you can report the content to our administrators by contacting us at support@premom.com.

Premom partner feature – Predad™

When you use our partner feature Predad, you as the primary account holder select the information to be shared with the connected partner account holder.  The partner account holder cannot download or edit the information you share.  

What information will be shared with your connected partner?

If you select for the sharing of Fertile Window or Period Tracking, your connected partner will receive information of your period duration, when the next period is expected, predicted ovulation day, and predicted fertile window.  The connected partner will also receive educational content and notifications based on your specific phase of menstrual cycle.

If you select for the sharing of Pregnancy Tracking, your connected partner will receive information regarding your pregnancy, including approximate duration of pregnancy, abstract image of the unborn baby based on approximate duration of pregnancy, as well as educational content and notifications based on your pregnancy status.  Sharing of Pregnancy Tracking information cannot be enabled unless sharing of Fertile Window or Period Tracking is also selected.   

What data will be collected from the connected partner?

If you are a connected partner, you will be receiving the information from the primary account holder.  To enable the connection, we will collect your Name, User Credentials, User Identifiers, Contact Information, User Content, as well as all technical and usage information provided under the Information We Collect Automatically section.

Ask AI, the Premom chat tool

We leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) in some of our Services, including our Ask AI feature.  When you interact with Ask AI, the information you provide may be recorded and stored on secure servers to enhance the functionality of Ask AI and improve the overall user experience.  This data, including chat logs and Personal Information you voluntarily share with Ask AI, may be transmitted to our customer service teams and vendors whose services are integrated into the tool, including to improve your conversation experience with Ask AI.

Cookies, Software Development Kits, and Other Technologies

When you use the Services, we and our vendors may use cookies or similar technologies (such as software development kits (SDKs)) to collect or receive certain information about your use of the Services. Some of these technologies that we use are “strictly necessary” or “required” for the Services to function. We also use analytics tools, such as to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Services. Such analytics tools may provide data, such as information about your engagement with the Services which may be used to provide content, analysis or functionality or to measure and analyze engagement with the Services.

Your Choices. Most browsers and devices are configured to accept cookies and similar tracking technologies automatically. You may be able to set your browser and device options so to limit such technologies. Choices are typically device and browser specific. Please see https://allaboutcookies.org/how-to-manage-cookies for additional information.

Retention of Your Personal Information

We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Information, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and applicable legal requirements.

If you choose to delete the App from your device (note that deletion of the App does not mean that your account is deleted – please contact us at support@premom.com if you wish to delete your account) or your account becomes inactive, we will retain your Personal Information for a period of five (5) years in case you decide to re-activate the Services or re-install the App. We have determined that this retention period is appropriate taking into account the factors described above and based on our experience with our App users, in order to secure your smooth experience with our App functions.

You may delete your account and erase your Personal Information at any time by contacting us at support@premom.com. Please note that if you choose to do this, your Personal Information will not be recoverable should you later create another account.

Please note that, in all cases, we may need to retain Personal Information for a longer period where we are subject to legal or regulatory requirements to do so.

Information Security

We believe that the largest threat to security and privacy is that someone could get your device and account information. You can help keep your Personal Information secure by properly selecting and protecting passwords, not sharing passwords with others, and preventing others from using your mobile device, laptop or other devices that can access the Services.

Links

Although the Services may contain links to other websites or services, we are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on those websites or services. The information practices of those websites or services are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You should read the privacy policy stated on that website or service before sharing your Personal Information with any websites or services.  We are not responsible for the privacy policies or other sites and encourage you to read their privacy policies.

European Economic Area, United Kingdom and California. You must be at least 16 years old to use the Services. If you are aware of anyone younger than 16 using the Services, please contact us at support@premom.com and we will take steps to delete their Personal Information and (or) delete their account.

Your Rights to Your Personal Information

You may have rights in relation to your Personal Information, including the right to delete your Personal Information (subject to certain limitations); access the Personal Information you enter into the Services; and ask us about what kind of Personal Information we have about you.

General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)

If you are in the EEA or UK, you have certain rights regarding the Personal Data we have about you that you can exercise in certain circumstances. The GDPR defines “Personal Data” as any information which is related to an identified or identifiable natural person.  These rights are to:

Access the Personal Data we have about you.
Correct the Personal Data we have about you.
Restrict the processing of your Personal Data
Have your Personal Data deleted (i.e., the “right to be forgotten”)
Object to the processing of your Personal Data
Not be subject to automated decision-making.
Take your Personal Data somewhere else (i.e., the right to portability)
Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your Personal Data for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. However, please note that if you withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able to provide you with our Services. You may contact us at support@premom.com to make any of these requests. We may require you to provide proof of your identity before we are able to fully review your request. Please note that, where we determine that we can grant your request, we will do so as soon as possible, but it may take us more time in some cases, for example for full erasure of your Personal Data stored in our backup systems. There may be situations where we are not required to comply with your request and we will let you know if one of those situations arises.

Our lawful basis for processing your Personal Data is typically going to be your consent, but we also may process your Personal Data because of a legal obligation, performance of a contract with you, or because we have a legitimate interest in doing so.

We use intelligent algorithms that provide certain App functions, such as predictions of your cycle and ovulation day. The more Personal Data about your cycle, ovulation tests, and BBT that our intelligence algorithm can work with, the better predictions you get from the algorithm.

We hope that you don’t ever have an issue with the way that we handle your Personal Data, but if you do, contact us at support@premom.com to let us know so that we can make it right. If you’re ever not happy with the way that we handle your request, you can file a complaint with your local supervisory authority.

The Services are hosted in the United States and are governed by United States law.

Where we further transfer your Personal Data in the United States and where required by law, we have put in place appropriate safeguards to protect your personal data. If you would like further information about this you can request it from support@premom.com.
