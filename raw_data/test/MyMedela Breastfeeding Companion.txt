This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.

Medela’s B2C Webshop Privacy & Cookie Policy governs the collection, processing and use of your personal data, when you visit and/or interact on our B2C Webshop.

This B2C Webshop Privacy & Cookie Policy (“Policy”) applies to the B2C Webshop platform (“Webshop”) which is operated by Medela UK Ltd., Unit 3, Huntsman Drive, Northbank Industrial Park, Irlam, Manchester M44 5EG, United Kingdom (“Medela” or “we”). Other webshops connected directly or indirectly with our Webshop, e.g., by hyperlinks, do not fall within the scope of this Policy, whether or not they are operated by Medela, an affiliated group company or partner.

This Policy governs the collection, processing and use of your personal data, when you visit and/or interact on our Webshop and explains our practices with respect to the placement of cookies, including the types of cookies we use and how you can manage them.

Collection, Processing and Use of Your Personal Data
1.1 Anonymous Usage of our Webshop

You are welcome to visit our Webshop while remaining anonymous and without revealing any of your personal data.

However, when you first visit our Webshop we will ask for your consent to place cookies on your device and to track your webshop usage behaviour. This helps us to better understand how our customers use our Webshop and to improve our webshop offering and services, which includes providing you with a more personalized webshop experience and targeted offers. In case you have registered for our newsletter (see Section 1.3 below), we will use such webshop usage information also to provide you with more personalized communications reflecting your specific interests and preferences. Please see Section 2 below for a detailed description of the cookies and webshop analysis tools we use for this purpose and your rights to change your choices.

If you do not agree with the above practices and wish to remain fully anonymous, you can indicate not to provide your consent, or withdraw your consent with effect for the future, by using the opt-out mechanisms available (see Section 2 below). In this case, we will only collect certain anonymous information which do not directly relate to your person. For example, we may collect the number of visitors to our Webshop, browsing patterns and areas of interest. We analyse this information to understand how our customers use our Webshop, and to assess trends, statistics and our customers’ needs, which help us to improve our Webshop and to better serve our customers.

Other than as indicated above, we will only collect your personal data if you voluntarily decide to share such information with us, such as by sending an enquiry (via our contact form) or requesting a specific service. Unless you have provided your explicit consent, and unless indicated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, we will use the personal data that you have shared with us only as necessary for enabling your use of our Webshop, including handling your requests and providing the requested services. Apart from that, we may use any personal data we receive only in anonymized form (i.e., in a non-personally identifiable form which does not allow for any conclusions as to your identity) for statistical purposes and for internal evaluation how to improve our products and services. Your data will not be processed for other purposes or beyond the scope of this Privacy Policy, except where expressly permitted or required by applicable law.

1.2 Using our Contact Form

We collect the personal data you voluntarily disclose when you contact us through the contact form on our Webshop, for example, if you send us an enquiry or file a specific request with our customer service and support. Unless indicated otherwise in this Policy, your data will not be used without your consent other than to handle your request/enquiry, e.g., to provide you with the service information you asked for, and not be used for any other purpose, unless expressly permitted or required by applicable law. Your request/enquiry will be handled by Medela.

1.3 Webshop Consent and Registration

In using our Webshop or by registering yourself thereon, we may ask for your consent to receive marketing communications. For example, you may register for our newsletter or you may register your Medela breast pump. When doing so we will ask you for your consent to send you marketing communications. By providing your consent, you agree to receive marketing communications from Medela. As part of your consent, we may personalize the content of these marketing communications according to your needs and interests based on other information we receive and store from you, such as your account information, baby due date/date of birth, order history, or other information revealed by you. In case you have also given your consent to the placement of cookies and the tracking of your Webshop usage behaviour (see Section 2.2 below), we will also use information about your Webshop usage to provide you with personalized communications which reflect your specific interests and preferences.

After you have submitted your registration request, you will receive a confirmation email which contains a link that you need to click on to confirm your registration. This double-opt-in procedure helps us to ensure that the email-account holder consents with the receipt of our marketing communication.

The wording of your consent declaration given when registering as described above can be viewed at the bottom of this Policy.

By consenting to marketing communications on our Webshop, you further consent that your receipt of communications from Medela, such as email-opens and email-clicks, may be tracked by Medela using an analytics tool provided by our third party service providers. This tool also collects information about email-forwarding, undeliverable emails and unsubscribes.

Our service providers will process your information as our data processor only on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions to help us evaluate the usage of our Webshop and email communications, to personalize the communications to you, to compile reports on activity and to provide other statistical and analytical services relating to the usage of our Webshop and email communications.

While these service providers may be located in a country which may not provide for the same level of data protection as considered adequate in the United Kingdom, we have taken the necessary measures to ensure your personal data is appropriately protected if being transferred outside of the UK.

You can unsubscribe from our Webshop at any time, and withdraw your consent to receive marketing communication with effect for the future, by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the marketing communication emails you received or on our Webshop within the account profile.

1.4 Processing of your orders: customer account

To be able to process your orders via our Webshop, you are invited to set up a customer account. Of course, you can always place your order as guest. During the registration process we ask you to provide your first and last name, an email address, address, country and a password.

After submitting your registration request, you will receive a confirmation e-mail with a link that you must click on to confirm your registration. This double opt-in process helps us to ensure that the owner of the email account is indeed the person registering on our Webshop.

We use the information you provide during the registration process (together with other information collected during the checkout process, including details of your order, delivery and billing address (unless already provided during registration), as well as the payment information provided and certain system-generated account information) solely to process and fulfill your orders, process payments, communicate with you regarding your orders (to the extent necessary to process your purchases and, if applicable, to provide customer service), and maintain your account with us. Such data is permanently stored with us and can be viewed by you at any time via your customer account profile and – if necessary – updated and deleted on request. If necessary, we also use this data to prevent or detect attempts at fraud or abuse on our Webshop.
