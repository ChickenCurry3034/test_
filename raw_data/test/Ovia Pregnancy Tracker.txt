Additional Information
Third Party Websites or Apps: Some ads or links within the Services may interface with or take you to websites or apps that are operated by other companies. Ovia is not responsible for the privacy practices of its advertisers or others. You should review the privacy policies of those sites and apps.

US Location: The data we collect is transferred to servers located in the US of our cloud computing provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS); some personal data may be transferred to other US-based vendors who provide services to Ovia, including the principal vendors listed here. If you are resident outside the US, your data may as a result become subject to US jurisdiction which may provide you with weaker data protection safeguards and rights than you would enjoy in your home jurisdiction. By accepting this Privacy Policy, using the Services or providing us with your personal data you acknowledge and consent to your personal data being transferred and/or processed as described in this Policy.

Children: The Services are not available to children under 13 or who otherwise require parental consent under applicable law to use the Services or provide personal information to Ovia. Ovia does not collect personal data from children under 13. Ovia does not show advertising to any user under the age of 16. Users under 18 are automatically opted-out of the sale or sharing of data for personalized advertising when local law requires it. Parents and guardians may include personal data about their baby or child in their Ovia account; the parent or guardian is responsible for ensuring they have the legal right to do so.

Deidentified Data and Aggregated Data: Ovia may use personal data to create deidentified data for research and development purposes. Deidentified data is not personal data as it is no longer linked or linkable to you. If we create a deidentified dataset we maintain it as such and will not re-identify it. We may provide deidentified data to our research partners, such as universities and medical research institutions for research, and to other businesses who have engaged us to provide research services on deidentified or aggregated data. Ovia may disclose or sell deidentified data derived from patient information (as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act); if so, such patient information is deidentified in accordance with HIPAA safe harbor or expert determination deidentification requirements. We may use personal data to create aggregated analytic data and statistics, which we may use for Ovia’s internal purposes or share with third parties. Ovia may receive compensation for sharing deidentified or aggregate data.


Social Media: Some Ovia content may appear on Ovia’s social media channels. Ovia does not collect personal data through those channels, and the respective privacy policies of the social media provider will apply to your usage of those channels. An exception to this is if we ask you to submit personal data (for example, your Instagram handle, email address or name) to us through social media messaging, which may occur as part of a giveaway or competition, in which case this Privacy Policy will apply.

Changes to this Policy
Ovia may modify this Policy from time to time by posting an updated version of the Policy. When we make material changes this Policy, we will notify users by email or in-app notification.
