(Last Updated: Nov 1, 2021)

Beijing Elex Technology Co., Ltd. (“ELEX,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is the operator and controller of various mobile applications and other online services and websites (collectively, the “Services”). We are dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our online users (“you,” “users,” and “user”), and have adopted this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, store, use, disclose, and manage your personal information and data. This Privacy Policy applies to the Services in which it is posted only. Unless otherwise stated at the time of collection, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected outside of the Services in which it is posted.

ELEX is a valid licensee and participating member of the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s Privacy Certified Program (“ESRB Privacy Certified”).

As a licensee of this privacy program, we are subject to audits of the Services and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by ESRB Privacy Certified.

If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service, please do not access or use our Services.

Note to Parents

The Services are intended for enjoyment by a broad audience. They are not directed to users under 13 years old (“Children” or “Child”). We do not knowingly collect or store personal information from Children. However, we do collect information, including personal information, from all users of the Services, as explained further in Section 1 below. If you believe we may have unintentionally collected personal information from your Child, please contact us using the information in the Contact Us section below.

In addition, we urge you to instruct your Children to never give out their real names, addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information when online, unless you have given them permission to do so. We also recommend you familiarize yourself with the parental controls available on the devices you provide to your Child (e.g., mobile phones and tablets) and keep a watchful eye on your Child’s online activity. If you have any concerns, please contact us immediately using the information in the Contact Us section below.

1.  Information We Collect About You AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION

We collect three main sources of personal information: (1) information you provide by interacting with our App; (2) information provided by your device, and (3) information from third-party sites or platforms that you link with your registration account.  The categories of information we collect are identifiers/contact information, demographic information (such as gender and age), commercial information, Internet or other electronic network activity information, geolocation data, audio, electronic, visual or similar information, and inferences drawn from the above.

A. Information You Provide To Us

There are several opportunities for you to provide or disclose personal information directly to us via the Services. The decision whether to provide the information to us belongs to you. If you prefer not to disclose the information, you will still be able to utilize the Services, but may not be able to utilize all aspects of them. The information you choose to provide to us will either be processed with your affirmative consent, pursuant to a contractual necessity or in furtherance of our legitimate business interests.

Profile Information: We collect information about you when you create or modify your profile, set preferences, and sign-up for or make purchases through the Services. For example, depending on the Service, you may have the option of adding a display name, profile photo, age, gender, geographic information and other details to your profile information to be displayed in the Service. 

Content you provide through our products: We collect and store content that you send, receive and share when you use the Services. This content includes any information about you that you may choose to include. Examples of content we collect and store include but are not limited to: your email address, when you choose to give it to us; the messages you post, exchange or reply in message boards, forums or chat areas, including, in certain Services, voice messages you send to your friends; information you provide in connection with a survey or contest; and any feedback you provide to us. Content also includes the files and links you upload to the Services, including art you create and share with us and other users in our Services, and pictures and audio recording you upload.

Content you provide through our websites: We also collect content you submit to our websites, which include social media or social networking websites operated by us (e.g., our Facebook pages). For example, you provide content to us when you provide feedback or when you participate in any interactive features, surveys, contests, promotions, activities, or events. 

Information you provide through our support channels: The Services also include our customer services and technical support, where you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing with a Service. Whether you speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team (or our third-party service providers), you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue. You may upload photos and voice messages to customer service. Whatever information you provide will be used solely to address your request for support.

Payment Information:  We collect certain payment and billing information when you purchase certain paid Services. You might also provide payment information, such as payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services.

 

B. Information Collected Automatically

We collect certain information automatically from and about the device(s) you utilize to access the Services and your use of the Services. Specifically, we and/or our third-party service providers collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address, type of device, operating system, browser type, language settings, device IDs, mobile advertising IDs (e.g., for Android users, the GPS ADID also known as the “Google Play Services ID for Android”), MAC address, GSSF ID, usage data (including the features of the Services you use, and when and how often you use the Services), URLs of referring/exit pages, and crash data. We use your IP address and/or country preference to approximate your location (i.e., country and, at times, city) to provide you with a better experience, and in some of our Services, we also collect precise geolocation data from your device (i.e., street-level). 

Some of the Services use cookies and similar tracking technologies, such as pixel tags, to automatically collect information from and about your device(s) and your use of the Services. A “cookie” is a small file that is saved on your computer or mobile device, which uniquely identifies your browser and provides information to the cookie sender. Pixel tags are small blocks of code on a webpage that allow websites to do things like read and place cookies. We also use third-party software development kits (also known as SDKs) in our mobile apps, which collect information about your device(s) and use of the Services. These trackers help us to deliver the Services to you, to improve your user experience and to analyze traffic on and use of the Services. In addition, they are used for marketing and advertising, including to help us to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and potentially for interest-based advertising by third parties.

CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident and the processing of personal information about you is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), you have certain rights with respect to that information. 

Right to Know: You have a right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected about you. You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such personal information. Note that we have provided much of this information in this privacy statement. You may make such a “request to know” by contacting us at cok@elex.com.

San Jose, CA 95112

Attn: Privacy 

Right to Opt-Out: You have a right to opt-out from future “sales” of personal information. Note that the CCPA defines “sell” and “personal information” very broadly, and some of our data sharing described in this privacy statement may be considered a “sale” under those definitions. In the past 12 months, we may have sold any of the categories of personal information described in the “Information We Collect” section above. To opt-out from “sales” of personal information, please visit our “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” page. 

We do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age. 

You may designate in writing, or through a power of attorney an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us. 

Further, to provide or delete specific pieces of personal information, we will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We will verify your request by asking you to send it from the email address associated with your account or requiring you to provide information necessary to verify your account. 

Finally, you have a right to receive notice of our practices at or before collection of personal information, and you have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights set out in the CCPA. 

Additionally, under California Civil Code section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, California residents who have provided personal information to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customers”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed, personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. 

Please be aware that we do not disclose personal information to any third parties for their direct market purposes as defined by this law. 

California residents under the age of 18 who are registered users of online sites, services, or applications have a right under California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 to remove, or request and obtain removal of, content or information they have publicly posted. To remover content or information you have publicly posted, please send a detailed description of the specific content or information you wish to have removed to cok@elex.com. Please be aware that your request does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal of content or information posted online and that the law may not permit or require removal in certain circumstances.

8.   Data Retention Policy

How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.  After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible. 

We retain your information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services.  We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you. We retain the information you share on the chatting areas for 24 hours. If you private chat with other users, we will retain only 800 messages.

Any personal information you provide in connection with a customer service request or inquiry will be deleted by our third-party service provider one year from the date of your request or inquiry.

9.   International Transfer of Your Information

Personal data may be transferred to, and stored in, a country operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the transfer of personal data to a country outside the EEA may take place where the European Commission has decided that the country ensures an adequate level of protection. In the absence of an adequacy decision, we may transfer personal data provided appropriate safeguards are in place.

Personal data collected from individuals, including those in the EEA, is stored on servers located in the United States and the Netherlands. We have verified that our Cloud Service Provider and data processors (where applicable) are certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. For additional information, please click here.

The Privacy Policy will indicate the date it was last updated. If we make a material change in the way we handle your personal information, we will provide you with additional notice by sending you an email at the last email address we have for you, if any, or by prominently posting notice of the change on the Services. If you do not agree with any changes we make to the Privacy Policy, please stop using the Services.
