Because these needs vary for different type of information, the context of our interactions with you or your use of Likee Services result in different retention periods for different type of information. Where we do not need your information in order to provide Likee Services to you, we retain it only for so long as we have a reasonable business purpose in keeping such data.

HOW TO MANAGE YOUR ACCOUNT AND INFORMATION

The privacy settings allow you to control whether or not to share certain information and whether you wish to entertain certain functions.

In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of certain of your personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information. Please be advised, however, that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the storage and transmission of your personal information.
