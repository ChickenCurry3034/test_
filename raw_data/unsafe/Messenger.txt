Reduce harmful content
We'll let you know if you receive content that we detect as misinformation or if it contains unsafe links. We also limit the number of times a message can be forwarded to at a time.

Protect your chats with end-to-end encryption
Personal messages and calls on Messenger will be end-to-end encrypted by default. That means that messages and calls can only be seen or heard by you and the person you send them to, and no one else—not even Meta. Keep in mind, for reporting and optional features, you or someone in the chat may still choose to share messages with Meta.

Your personal messages are private
We want you to know how we use your information. We collect information from Messenger so that we can improve the product experience and keep people safe and secure. We don’t use the content of your personal messages for ads personalization. Some types of messages that aren’t personal include messages to and from business accounts, messages exchanged with Meta when using products like Meta AI, and messages in features designed to be more public, like channels.

Meta also adds an additional layer of privacy by securing personal messages and calls on Messenger with end-to-end encryption, which means nobody, including Meta, can see or listen to what’s sent or said in your calls or messages. Keep in mind, for reporting and optional features, you or someone in the chat may still choose to share messages with Meta.
