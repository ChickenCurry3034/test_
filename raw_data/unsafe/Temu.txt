Protect Yourself from Spam Text Messages and Phishing Scams
Beware of spam messages, emails, and phone calls! Scammers frequently use these communication methods to steal personal and financial information. To protect yourself, we recommend that you do not respond to these messages or calls, and avoid clicking on links in emails or text messages from unknown sources. If you're uncertain about the legitimacy of a message, it's better to be safe and report it to us. If you require assistance, please contact our customer service team, and we will investigate your reports thoroughly to ensure your information stays safe and secure.

Please tell us if:

1. You were approached by an unknown third party claiming to be a courier, asking for extra shipping charges.





2. You were approached by a merchant claiming to be from Temu asking you to make transactions via other channels outside of Temu (QR code, e-wallet, wire transfer, etc).



3. You were tricked into purchasing items and into initiating payments/transactions for a fake website/app similar to Temu with a notification that you had won something.



4. You received any messages from an unknown number offering financial service or a part-time job, and were asked to fill in personal information (e.g. your Temu account information or transaction number).



5. You received a call from an unknown number asking you to disclose/verify your personal information or offering you a refund you did not request.

6. You receive false job advertisements impersonating temu. They usually offer low threshold and high income to attract you to enter your personal information.





7. An official calling himself Temu finds you and offers to start business cooperation with you.

How to recognise scam emails?
You may receive an email that appear to be from Temu but are actually from scammers. These emails usually direct you to a fake website that looks very similar to temu.com and ask you for account information, such as your email address and password. After stealing your sensitive information, these fake sites may use it for more fraudulent activities. Some phishing emails may contain viruses or malware that steal your passwords or sensitive information. It is recommended to install antivirus software and keep it updated at all times. Here are a few pointers for recognizing fraudulent emails:

1. Official Temu emails do not ask you to provide the following information:

Your social security number (SSN) or Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)

Your credit card number or your PIN

Your credit card security code

Your Temu password

Information that could be used to answer security questions, such as your parents' names

2. Asking you to pay a shipping fee to get free gifts

Temu will not ask you to pay additional fees via email or text message after you have placed your order. Examples include fees for a free gift or surprise box and fees for customs clearance. Click here to view more examples. If you receive an email like this, please do not pay any fees and forward the email directly to reportphishing@temu.com (preferably as an attachment). If you have already paid, please contact customer service for help.

3. Attachments in suspicious e-mails

Temu will not ask you to open attachments in emails for order confirmation and we do not allow our merchants to make such requests to buyers. Please do not open any attachments in suspicious emails or emails from strangers. If you receive an email with attachments claiming to be from Temu, please do not open the attachments and forward the email directly to reportphishing@temu.com (preferably as an attachment), deleting it after sending. If you open these attachments, please run antivirus or anti-malware software.

4. Grammatical or spelling errors

Look out for grammatical or spelling errors in emails. Some phishing emails are translated from other languages or are not proofread before being sent so they often contain grammatical or spelling errors.

5. Sender's email domain

Sometimes you can determine the authenticity of an email by looking at the domain name of the sender's email address. You can be sure that it is a fraudulent email if the domain name of the email is not one of the following: temu.com / temuemail.com / temumail.com / temuofficial.com / temufavor.com

6. If the email looks suspicious, visit the Temu website directly

If you are skeptical about the email, please do not click on the links in it. Please go directly to the official Temu page and click on My Account at the top right of the page to view your recent purchases or other account information. If you are unable to access your account or have any other issues, please contact our customer service as soon as possible.

7. Protect your account information

If you have clicked on a fraudulent or suspicious email and entered your Temu account information, please go to the Temu website immediately to change your account password. To change your password, go to My Account > Account Settings > Change Account Settings.

Guidelines for safe internet access
1. How to avoid phishing scams

Beware of spam messages, emails, and phone calls. Scammers frequently use these communication methods to steal personal and financial information.Click to see examples of common scams. To protect yourself, we recommend that you do not respond to these messages or calls, and avoid clicking on links in emails or text messages from unknown sources. If you're uncertain about the legitimacy of a message, you can contact our customer service representatives to be safe. We will investigate the information you provide to ensure your information stays safe and secure.

2. How to keep your payment information safe

- Always use websites with the padlock symbol.

- Check your bank statements often and report any anomalies to your bank.

- Report lost or stolen cards immediately.

- Do not select to save your card information or credentials on any shared devices.

3. Before you report a potential unauthorised transaction on your card, please consider the below

- Was the order placed by a friend, family member, or someone who has access to your payment details?

- Are there other cards associated with the payment account that may have been used?

- Have you recently canceled an order? Some banks show this transaction as pending.

If you believe you've been a victim of fraud please contact us with details of the transaction and we can assist you further.

4. Keep your email secure with strong passwords

Your email account contains a lot of personal information about you and is usually linked to other online accounts you use. If your email account is compromised, all your other passwords can be reset. So it's important to secure your email account with a strong password that is different from all your other passwords.

To create one, we recommend the '3 random words' method: simply choose three random, memorable words that mean something to you when put together - the longer and less obvious the connection the better.For example: MagicalCardWater.

5. Don't use unsecured public Wi-Fi networks

Free public Wi-Fi connections offered in coffee shops or airports often have little or no security. It's easy for hackers to monitor traffic on the network, including your email details. The way to protect against attacks is to stick to trusted or password-protected networks. Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is also safe as it protects and encrypts your connection data.

6. Remember to log out when using a public computer or device

If you use a public computer to check your email but don't log out before leaving, someone who uses that computer later can get your password and use it to hack into your account. After using a public computer or device, remember to log out correctly. Also note that public computers can be infected with malware or spyware, so use them with caution.

How to recognise if SMS messages are actually from an official courier?
Cybercriminals lure users into clicking on phishing websites to check tracking updates for their packages by sending fraudulent text messages saying "parcel not received" or "wrong address". This scam is even more prevalent during the holiday season when many of us are waiting for a delivery.

These scams contain links that appear to be from the official courier/package tracking websites and ask you to enter information such as your name, email address, and bank card number. A few days after you have done so, there is a good chance that your bank card will be stolen. Some of the scams will also directly ask you to make an online payment in order for the package to be delivered properly.

The above are common means of SMS fraud. If you have any questions about delivery issues, please check the order details page on Temu's official website or contact Temu customer service. Do not click on any suspicious links sent via SMS.

Here is more detailed information given by couriers that Temu often uses to help you recognise if SMS messages are actually from an official courier.

1. EVRI

Evri SMS messages:

- Will not show the sender name as a mobile phone number

- Will never ask you for payment

- Will never include a link except for a tracking link called https://evri.link/...... (Please be aware even if the link does show as https:/evri.link/..... we cannot guarantee this is genuine. If you are unsure do not click a link and do not enter any personal details - see the Fake ''missed parcel'' messages section above.)

See more anti-fraud alerts from Evri: https://www.evri.com/cyber-security

2. Royal Mail

In cases where customers need to pay a surcharge for an underpaid item, we would let them know by leaving a grey Fee To Pay card. We would not request payment by email or text.

The only time we would ask customers to make a payment by email or by SMS is in instances where a customs fee is due. In such cases, we would also leave a grey card telling customers that there's a Fee to Pay before we can release the item. This would apply either to an international customs fee or to a surcharge for an underpaid item.

See more anti-fraud alerts from Royal Mail: https://www.royalmail.com/help/scam-protection

3. USPS

The Postal Service offers free tools to track specific packages, but customers are required to either register online, or initiate a text message, and provide a tracking number. USPS does not charge for these services! USPS will not send customers text messages or e-mails without a customer first requesting the service with a tracking number, and it will NOT contain a link. So, if you did not initiate the tracking request for a specific package directly from USPS and it contains a link: don't click the link!

See more anti-fraud alerts from USPS:https://faq.usps.com/s/article/Scams-Scheme-Alerts

4. UPS

- Slow Down - Scammers rely on urgency to create panic. Be cautious of anything that implies you must act immediately. Take the time to review the message, then review it again.

- Don't Click - Check the Link - Legitimate UPS links will start with ''https://www.ups.com'', ''https://billing.ups.com'' or ''https://links4.upsemail.com''.

- Check the Details - Are there spelling or grammar errors? Generic greetings, like ''Sir or Madame?'' Fraudsters will frequently use small typos to trick you into clicking on the link.

- Report It - Report it to the https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/?orgcode=UPS.

- Delete and Block It - So you don't accidentally interact with it later.

- If It Seems Too Good To Be True, It Probably Is - Scammers may sell fake labels at deep discounts.

See more anti-fraud alerts from UPS: https://www.ups.com/us/en/support/shipping-support/legal-terms-conditions/fight-fraud.page

5. FedEx

FedEx does not request, via unsolicited mail, email, or text, any personal information pertaining to your account credentials or identity.Indications that this is a suspicious email include:

- Urgent request for money in return for the delivery of your packages.

- Requests for your personal and financial information.

- Misspelled website or email addresses, like fedx.com or fed-ex.com.

- Spelling and grammatical errors, or excessive capitalization and exclamation points.

- Claims that you have won a large sum of money.

- A message that appears when you click a link, warning you that the connection isn't secure. This means the browser you use recognizes a security risk.

See more anti-fraud alerts from FedEx: https://www.fedex.com/en-us/report-fraud.html

6. Canada Post

- Check the number from which a text message has been sent to ensure it is from the trusted Canada Post short code number 272727 or 55555

- Unless you have requested email or text notifications, delete them immediately

- Do not click on links in suspicious emails or text messages as they may contain malicious viruses or lead you to a fake website

- Do not reply to the emails or the text messages, even if the text or email tells you to click on ''Unsubscribe'' or text ''STOP'' to stop receiving messages

What certifications has Temu obtained to ensure user payment and information security?
Beware of various telephone scams and how to deal with them
We have been notified that people are receiving scam calls disguised as our office number, stating they are from the "Temu Customer Service." The scammer will obtain the person's name, address, and phone number from somewhere else and try to convince them to provide information such as payment information and bank card numbers.

In some phone scams, they act friendly and helpful. In others, they threaten or try to scare you. They'll do what it takes to get your money or your personal information to commit identity theft. Don't give it to them. Here's what you need to know.

How To Recognize a Phone Scam

Phone scams come in many forms, but they tend to make similar promises and threats, or ask you to pay certain ways. Here's what to know.

1, Temu will not call you out of the blue to ask for your card number and other sensitive information and ask you to transfer money

2, Scammers may pretend to be law enforcement or a federal agency. They may say you will be arrested, fined, or deported if you don't pay your taxes immediately or that there is a criminal case. Their goal is to scare you into paying. But real law enforcement and federal agencies will not call and threaten you.

3, Scammers will often insist you pay in a way that makes it hard to get your money back - by wire transfer , gift card, cryptocurrency, or payment app. Anyone who insists that you can only pay that way is a scammer.

4, You don't have to make a decision right away. Most phone scammers will put pressure on you to make a decision on the spot.

How To Stop Calls From Scammers

1, A good way to deal with unwanted calls is to block them. Cell phones, home phones that make calls over the internet, and landlines each have their own call-blocking options. Some companies also offer call labeling. With call labeling, shady calls will still come through, but you'll see things like "spam" or "scam likely" on your phone's screen when they do. Then you'll decide whether to answer the call.

2, Don't trust your caller ID. Scammers can make any name or number show up on your caller ID. So even if the call appears to be from an official source such as a logistics service provider, or appears to be coming from a local number, it could be from a scammer anywhere in the world.
