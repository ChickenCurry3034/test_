You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by reason of exploitation of the User Content you make available on or through the Services in accordance with these Terms.

We reserve the right to refuse to publish, cut, edit, crop, block, disallow, take down, delete or remove any User Content for any reason at our sole discretion (e.g., if such User Content is deemed inappropriate according to applicable laws or guidelines, or in response to third party complaints) with or without notice and without liability to you.

You are solely responsible for your User Content, and we recommend that you keep a back-up copy of it at all times. We do not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, appropriateness or quality of any User Content, and under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any User Content.

We make no guarantee that your User Content will not be copied, reproduced, distributed or otherwise used without your authorization. You agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, we shall not be liable to you for any such unauthorized use of your User Content, and you hereby waive and agree not to assert any claim against us arising out of or in connection therewith. You understand that even if you seek to delete User Content from the Services, it may as a technical and administrative matter take some time or not be possible to achieve – for example, we may not be able to prevent any third party from storing or using any of your User Content that you have made public via the Services.

You acknowledge that we have the right to disclose your identity to a third party who claims that any User Content posted or uploaded by you on our Services infringes on such third party's intellectual property rights, privacy or other proprietary rights or if we are required to disclose your identity under applicable laws.

We reserve the right to change the price for the Premium Services from time to time and/or the features and functions available with the Premium Services in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion, and we will use commercially reasonable effort to communicate any such changes to you in advance. Price changes will be effective at the time of renewal of your subscription. As such, please make sure you read any notification of price changes carefully.

The currency applicable to your payment may depend on various factors (e.g., the jurisdiction where you make the purchase and the app store through which you make the purchase).

You can pay for Subscription Fees via your valid Apple ID account. All payment will be processed in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of Apple App Store. You agree that when you pay the Subscription Fees, (a) you authorize Apple to save your information of your chosen payment methods and continue billing your chosen payment method (e.g., credit card) to avoid interruption of the Premium Services, and (b) the taxes payable by you may be calculated based on the billing information that you provide at the time of purchase.

If there is any failure of payment via your chosen payment method (for example, such payment is rejected, denied, not received by us), we may not be able to provide you or terminate to provide you with the Premium Services until payment is properly processed, and you are liable for any fees, costs, expenses or other amounts arising from such failure of payment.

Subscription Renewals and Cancellations

You agree that your subscription of the Premium Services will automatically renew for additional periods equal in duration to your preceding subscription term, and you authorize Apple to charge the Subscription Fees and applicable taxes automatically through your chosen payment method at the start of each new subscription period.

You can cancel or adjust your subscription of the Premium Services via Settings - iTunes Account & App Store- Apple ID - View Apple ID - Subscriptions.
